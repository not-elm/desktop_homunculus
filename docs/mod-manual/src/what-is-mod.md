# What is MOD?

A **MOD** (modification) in Desktop Homunculus is a custom extension that allows you to add new functionality, user
interfaces, and behaviors to your desktop companion.
MODs are the primary way to customize and extend your Desktop Homunculus experience.

## Core Capabilities

MODs enable you to:

### üé® **Create Custom User Interfaces**

- Build interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interfaces
- Create floating windows, control panels, and overlays
- Position UI elements relative to your VRM characters
- Design transparent or styled windows that integrate seamlessly with your desktop

### ü§ñ **Control VRM Characters**

- Spawn, position, and animate VRM characters using 3D transforms
- Make characters speak using VoiceVox integration and AI-powered chat
- Play VRMA animations with precise control over repeat patterns and transitions
- Access character bone hierarchy for detailed pose manipulation
- Implement character state machines and automated routines

### üéÆ **Add Interactive Features**

- Respond to user clicks, drags, and keyboard input
- Create context menus that appear when right-clicking characters
- Add system tray menu items for quick access to MOD features
- Implement real-time communication between different parts of your MOD

### üåê **Integrate External Services**

- Connect to web APIs and external services
- Implement custom AI integrations beyond the built-in GPT support
- Create bridges to other applications and services

### üéµ **Add Audio and Visual Effects**

- Play sound effects and background music
- Display visual effects like stamps and animations
- Control screen overlays and atmospheric effects
- Synchronize effects with character actions and speech

## MOD Architecture

MODs in Desktop Homunculus are built around several key components:

### üìÅ **Asset-Based Structure**

MODs are organized as directories containing:

- **HTML files** for user interfaces
- **JavaScript/TypeScript files** for scripting logic
- **Images and icons** for visual elements
- **Audio files** for sound effects
- **Configuration files** defining MOD behavior

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration-Driven**

MODs use a `mod.json` file to declare:

- Basic MOD metadata (name, version, author)
- Menu items and user interface entry points
- Startup scripts that run when the application starts
- System integrations like tray menu items

### üåê **Web Technology Based**

MODs leverage familiar web technologies:

- **HTML/CSS** for rich user interface design
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** for interactive behavior
- **Standard web APIs** for common functionality
- **Custom SDK** for Desktop Homunculus specific features

### üîÑ **Real-Time Communication**

MODs can communicate through:

- **HTTP REST API** for request/response operations (localhost:3100)
- **Server-Sent Events** for real-time data streaming and character events
- **Command system** for cross-MOD communication via pub/sub patterns
- **Event streams** for reacting to user interactions (clicks, drags, state changes)
- **Deno Runtime** providing secure JavaScript/TypeScript execution environment

## Types of MODs

### **UI-Focused MODs**

Perfect for creators who want to build interactive interfaces:

- **Chat interfaces** for conversing with AI-powered characters
- **Settings panels** for configuring application behavior
- **Status displays** showing real-time information
- **Control dashboards** for managing multiple characters

### **Script-Focused MODs**

Ideal for automating character behavior:

- **Automated routines** that run on schedules
- **Character AI behaviors** that respond to events
- **Data processing scripts** that work with external APIs
- **Background services** that enhance the core experience

### **Hybrid MODs**

Combining UI and scripting for complex functionality:

- **Interactive games** where users play with their characters
- **Productivity tools** that integrate with work workflows
- **Entertainment systems** providing music, videos, or stories
- **Social features** connecting with friends and communities

## Getting Started

Ready to create your first MOD? The journey involves:

1. **Planning Your MOD**: Define what you want to build and how users will interact with it
2. **Setting Up the Structure**: Create the directory layout and configuration files
3. **Building the Interface**: Design HTML/CSS interfaces if your MOD needs UI
4. **Adding Functionality**: Write JavaScript/TypeScript code for interactive behavior

The next section will guide you through creating your first MOD step by step.
